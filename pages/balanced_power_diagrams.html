          <h3>Balanced Centroidal Power Diagrams:</h3>
          <p class="documentation">
    
            We consider the problem of political <em>redistricting</em>: given the
            locations of people in a geographical area (e.g.~a US~state), the
            goal is to decompose the area into subareas, called <em>districts</em>, so
            that the populations of the districts are as close as possible and
            the districts are ``compact'' and ``contiguous,'' to use the terms
            referred to in most US state constitutions and/or US Supreme Court
            rulings.
    
            We study a method that outputs a solution in which each district is
            the intersection of a convex polygon with the geographical area.
            The average number of sides per polygon is less than six. The
            polygons tend to be quite compact. Every two districts differ in
            population by at most one (so we call the solution <em>balanced</em>).
    
            In fact,
            the solution is a <em>centroidal power diagram</em>: each polygon has an
            associated <em>center</em> in &#8477;&#179; such that
          <ul>
            <li> the projection of the center onto the plane <em>z</em> = 0 is the
              centroid of the locations of people assigned to the polygon, and
            <li> for each person assigned to that polygon, the polygon's center
              is closest among all centers. The polygons are convex because they
              are the intersections of 3D Voronoi cells with the plane.
          </ul>
          The solution is, in a well-defined sense, a locally optimal solution to the problem
          of choosing centers in the plane and choosing an assignment of people
          to those 2-d centers so as to minimize the sum of squared distances
          subject to the assignment being balanced.
    
          A practical problem with this approach is that, in real-world redistricting,
          exact locations of people are unknown. Instead, the input consists of
          polygons (<em>census blocks</em>) and associated populations. A real
          redistricting must not split census blocks. We therefore propose
          a <em>second phase</em> that perturbs the solution slightly so it does not
          split census blocks. In our experiments, the second phase
          achieves this while preserving <em> perfect population balance</em>.
          The district polygons are no longer convex at
          the fine scale because their boundaries must follow the boundaries of
          census blocks, but at a coarse scale they preserve the shape of the
          original polygons. <br> <br>A conference version of this paper
